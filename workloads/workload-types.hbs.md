# Overview of workloads

This topic provides you with an overview of workload types in Tanzu Application Platform
(commonly known as TAP).

## Workload features

Tanzu Application Platform allows you to quickly build and test applications regardless of your
familiarity with Kubernetes.

You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.
You can also use supply chains to build applications that process work from a message queue,
or provide arbitrary network services.

A workload allows you to choose application specifications, such as repository location, environment
variables, service binding, and so on. For more information about workload creation and management,
see [Create or update a workload](../cli-plugins/apps/tutorials/create-update-workload.hbs.md).

The Out of the Box Supply Chains support a range of workload types, including scalable web
applications (`web`), traditional application servers (`server`), background applications
(`worker`), and serverless functions. You can use a collection of workloads of different types to
deploy microservices that function as a logical application, or deploy your entire application as a
single monolith.

If you build your own supply chains, you can define additional deployment methods beyond those
included in the Out of the Box Supply Chain templates.

## <a id="types"></a> Available Workload types

When using the Out of the Box Supply Chain, the `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type` annotation
selects which style of deployment is suitable for your application. The valid values are:
