# Overview of workloads

This topic provides you with an overview of workload types in Tanzu Application Platform
(commonly known as TAP).

## <a id="workload-features"></a> Workload features

Tanzu Application Platform allows you to quickly build and test applications regardless of your
familiarity with Kubernetes.

You can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.
You can also use supply chains to build applications that process work from a message queue,
or provide arbitrary network services.

A workload allows you to choose application specifications, such as
repository location, environment variables, service binding, and so on.
For more information about workload creation and management, see
[Commands Details](../cli-plugins/apps/reference/reference.hbs.md).

The Out of the Box supply chains support a range of workload types, including

- Scalable web applications (`web`)
- Traditional application servers (`server`)
- Background applications (`worker`)
- Serverless functions

You can use a collection of workloads of different types to deploy microservices that function as a
logical application. Alternatively, you can deploy your entire application as a single monolith.

If you build your own supply chains, you can define additional deployment methods beyond those in
the Out of the Box supply-chain templates.

## <a id="types"></a> Available workload types

When using the Out of the Box supply chain, the `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/workload-type` annotation
selects which style of deployment is suitable for your application. The valid values are:
