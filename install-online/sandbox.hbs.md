# Access an experimental sandbox environment

This topic describes how you can access a hosted experimental Tanzu Application Platform
(formerly known as TAP) environment.

VMware provides an experimental developer sandbox that you can use for 8
hours.
Your sandbox session takes 2 minutes to start, though it can take up to 25 minutes.
The sandbox environment includes the following services:

- Spring Cloud Services: Application Config Service, Spring Cloud Gateway and AppSSO
- Data Services: PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka and MongoDB

Get started with your [developer sandbox](https://tanzu.academy/guides/developer-sandbox) in the
Tanzu Academy.

**Note** This is an evaluation environment only, do not use it for production applications or to
store sensitive data.
