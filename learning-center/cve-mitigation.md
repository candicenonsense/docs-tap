# CVE mitigation

## <a id="CVE-2023-26114"></a>CVE-2023-26114

**Description:**
Versions of the package code-server before 4.10.1 are vulnerable to Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets handshakes, affecting those who use older browsers that do not support SameSite cookies and those who access code-server under a shared domain with other users on separate sub-domains. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an adversary to access data from, and connect to, the code-server instance. GHSA ID: GHSA-frjg-g767-7363

**Learning Center Context:**
Learning Center includes VS Code server as an IDE for the workshop session, giving users the possibility to create and modify workshop files. Each time there is a new session, the operator will deploy a new VS Code instance used only for that specific session for a single user. This VS Code server is an ephemeral instance used only by a user for a specific amount of time declared in the workshop definition and after that amount of time, the learning center operator removes the workshop resources and the VS Code instance. 

**Mitigation:**
There are some ways to mitigate this issue:

- If you don't require an IDE for your workshop, disable the VS Code editor in the workshop definition. [Enabling editor](../learning-center/runtime-environment/workshop-definition.hbs.md#enabling-the-integrated-editor)

- Enable an event access code on the portal, so there is no way to consume the VS Code instance without the access code. [Event access code](../learning-center/runtime-environment/training-portal.hbs.md#specify-an-event-access-code)

- Reduce the exposition by setting up workshop sessions to expire after a set time. Once expired, the workshop session is deleted. [Event access code](../learning-center/runtime-environment/training-portal.hbs.md#expiration-of-workshop-sessions)

- Some load balancers are able to allow access only from specific IPs. If this is an available option, configure the load balancer to limit access to the company network or specific IPs.
