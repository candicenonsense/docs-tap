## <a id="wait-lang-server"></a> The Tanzu Workloads panel shows `waiting on language server...`

### Symptom

The Tanzu Workloads panel shows `waiting on language server...`.

### Cause

### Solution

## <a id="freq-app-restarts"></a> Frequent application restarts

### Symptom

When an application is applied from Visual Studio it restarts frequently.

### Cause

An application or environment behavior is triggering the application to restart.

Observed trigger behaviors include:

- The application itself writing logs to the file system in the application directory that Live Update
  is watching
- Autosave being set to a very high frequency in the IDE configuration

### Solution

Prevent the trigger behavior. Example solutions include:

- Prevent 12-factor applications from writing to the file system.
- Reduce the autosave frequency to once every few minutes.
